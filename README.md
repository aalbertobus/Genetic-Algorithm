Genetic-Algorithm
=================
Simple Binary Genetic Algorithm for the Artificial Intelligence II class of Rafael Vazquez (ITCH2 Chihuahua Mexico)

the whole process just works with 1 parameter
steps before crossing could be easily adapted to use multiple parameters.

it generates an initial population screenshoot and a txt file with all the initial population
and results file with the best solutions.
